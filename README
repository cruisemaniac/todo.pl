Perl script that 'apes' the functionality of Gina Trapani's todo.txt

To run the script:
todo.pl {adxl} Task detail


Open the script file in a text editor and modify the $TODODIR parameter to configure where you want the todo.txt and done.txt files to exist. Mentioning a folder in your dropbox makes the files available everywhere.
Leaving the parameter blank will create the supporting text files in the same folder as the script.


Parameters:
-----------

a | add - add new task
d | done - mark task as done and move to done file
l | list - List active / pending tasks
x | delete - delete task number as in list

Functionality yet to implement:

* Modifying tasks
* Adding search / reporting functionality
